# FlareSolverr is a proxy server to bypass Cloudflare and DDoS-GUARD protection.
# https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr

# Jackett works as a proxy server: it translates queries from apps (Sonarr, SickRage, CouchPotato, Mylar, etc)
# into tracker-site-specific http queries, parses the html response, then sends results back to the requesting software.
# This allows for getting recent uploads (like RSS) and performing searches. Jackett is a single repository
# of maintained indexer scraping & translation logic - removing the burden from other apps.
